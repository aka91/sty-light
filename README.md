# sty-light
This project is a student lead activity as Engineering Capstone project consisting of a group of 6 people.
In this project, we are building a modern note-taking device that consists of a projector and a stylus to enable students to take notes on their cell phones. With the ability to turn any flat surface into a notebook, this project is distinguished by its lightweight design and compact packaging. The user can interact with the projected screen in real time, saving any work digitally for later access across all devices.
